/**
 * Protocol elements shared between the orchestration system and the agent.
 *
 * Centralized so any rename / addition is one-stop, and so plain `grep`
 * across the codebase finds every reference.
 *
 * Format split — important to understand:
 *  - **Inbound (system → agent)** uses `<turn_context>...</turn_context>`
 *    XML style envelope. These never reach the chat platform; they only
 *    exist in the agent's message context where AI is good at reading
 *    XML. The name `turn_context` (vs the older `chat_info`) is meant to
 *    signal to the model that fields here are LIVE PER-TURN state — values
 *    can change between turns (user moves channel, runs `;callme`, …) and
 *    that's expected, not an anomaly worth questioning.
 *  - **Outbound (agent → us → chat platform)** uses `[koishi:...]`
 *    bracket form for any protocol marker or real element the agent wants
 *    rendered. The sanitizer h.text()-escapes the *entire* agent output
 *    by default; only bracket-form patterns get lifted as elements or
 *    dropped as markers. This means raw `<` `>` in agent text never
 *    collide with our protocol — both can coexist because the protocol
 *    doesn't use angle brackets at all on the outbound side.
 *
 * Categories:
 *  - **Element type names**: bare `turn_context`, `user_message`, etc.
 *    Used for `h.parse(...).type` comparison on inbound envelope.
 *  - **Self-closing markers**: full `[koishi:silent]` strings the agent
 *    emits inline. Used by agent-loop and stream-splitter for detection.
 *  - **Block tags** (inbound only): paired open/close XML strings used
 *    to wrap envelope blocks in user messages.
