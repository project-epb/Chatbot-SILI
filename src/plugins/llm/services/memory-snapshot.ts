/**
 * Render the user's long-term memory as a `<long_term_memory>` XML
 * block to embed at the start of a synthetic / first user message in a
 * fresh conversation. Two callers use this:
 *
 *   - SummaryCompactor — prepends the snapshot to the synthetic
 *     "please summarize" user message that seeds a compacted session
 *   - chat.tsx — prepends the snapshot to the FIRST user envelope of
 *     any brand-new conversation (initial chat, post-`llm.reset`, idle
 *     rotation), so non-compaction-spawned sessions also get the
 *     memory bootstrap and don't waste a round-trip on read_user_memory
 *
 * Effect: memory becomes part of the cached prefix for the entire new
 * conversation, the model has it in context from turn 1 without a
 * tool call, and routine "what do you remember about me" questions
 * are answerable instantly. The note inside the block tells the model
 * the snapshot is frozen and to call `read_user_memory` for fresh
 * data if the conversation has run long enough that updates may have
 * landed.
 *
 * Returns '' when the user has no memory yet (or fetch fails), so
 * users without memory rows aren't burdened with empty placeholder
 * text in their fresh conversations.
