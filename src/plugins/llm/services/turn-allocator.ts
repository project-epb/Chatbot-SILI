/**
 * Per-conversation monotonic turn-number allocator.
 *
 * Each chat invocation calls `allocate(conversation_id)` to get the
 * next integer for its turn (1, 2, 3, ...). The number is paired with
 * `intra_turn_seq` (assigned by the chat handler — user=0, then 1, 2,
 * ... for assistant/tool rows) to form the sort key for history.
 *
 * Design notes
 * ------------
 * - In-memory counter per conversation_id, lazily initialized from the
 *   db's current max(turn_number) the first time we see the id.
 * - Allocation is synchronous after init: `++counter`. This means even
 *   when an old chat hasn't persisted its `user` row yet, the next chat
 *   that calls `allocate` gets a strictly larger number — race against
 *   db state cannot collide because we never re-read max once
 *   initialized.
 * - The `ActiveChatRegistry` already serializes chat invocations per
 *   owner, so concurrent allocate() on the same conversation is rare,
 *   but we still guard via an in-flight init promise so two near-
 *   simultaneous first-time allocates share one db read.
 * - Single-process assumption: this service is the source of truth
 *   within one koishi process. Cross-process replicas would need an
 *   atomic counter in the db; we don't deploy that way.
